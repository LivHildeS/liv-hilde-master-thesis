    \caption{ \textbf{Average cookie consent answer times and withdrawal times}. Even though the withdrawal data is sparse, the data clearly suggests that withdrawing consent takes longer than giving it. The answer times are in seconds. The column ``\textbf{n}'' denotes the amount of withdrawals. The ``\textbf{Answer} (no withdraws)'' columns shows average answer time only for the participants that did not withdrawal for that website and device. These values are used in the Mann-Withney-U test against the withdrawal times. The test are ran if both groups has at least 3 values, but the u-value and p-value must be interpreted with care since the group sizes are small and unbalanced. }
