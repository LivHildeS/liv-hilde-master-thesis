    \caption{ \textbf{Shapiro-Wilk normality statistics for time spent on cookie banners on different devices.} When considering the average response time on computer, Shapiro-Wilk rejects normality for most groups. However, on phone, many groups have high \textbf{W} and p-values, suggesting that the data is approximately normal. Nevertheless, this is only for a small number of groups overall.  The  Shapiro-Wilk test statistic \textbf{W}, highlighted in \textbf{bold} if it is greater than 0.9. The p-value is highlighted in \textbf{bold} if it is less than 0.05. }
