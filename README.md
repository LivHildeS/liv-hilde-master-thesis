# Deceptive Cookies: Conset by Desgin - A Mixed Method Study

## About

This repository contains the code used to quantitativly analyse the data in my master's thesis. It makes descriptive statistics, performs hypothesis tests and creates tables and output used in the thesis.

The data used is not shared, it is only presented in aggregates forms found in the tables and figures.

The processing mostly uses `pandas` dataframes, with hypothesis tests from `scipy`.

## Structure

The main file is `main.py`, which can be run with `python main.py`. The python packages can be found in `requirements.txt`.

The source code can be found in `src/`, with separate files for loading and processing data, making well formed paths, performing hypothesis tests, making LaTeX tables and more. Some constants, such as folder names, filenames and column names of the data, can be found in `constants.yaml`.
